# Data & API Rules

## Database & ORM
- Use Prisma as ORM with schema in `/prisma/schema.prisma`
- Follow repository pattern for database access
- Separate data access logic from business logic

## API Validation
- Validate API requests and responses with Zod
- Ensure type safety for all API interactions
- API routes must return typed JSON responses

## Data Patterns
- Use consistent error handling across API routes
- Implement proper data validation at API boundaries
- Follow RESTful conventions for API design

## Type Safety
- Define clear interfaces for API responses
- Use TypeScript types for database models
- Ensure end-to-end type safety from database to frontend
