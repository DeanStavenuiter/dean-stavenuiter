## End-to-End Testing
- Use Cypress for E2E testing if the project requires it
- Test critical user flows and business processes
- Maintain E2E tests for core application functionality

## Test Organization
- Place tests close to the code they test
- Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior
- Group related tests logically

## Quality Standards
- Maintain high code quality through consistent testing practices
- Write tests that are maintainable and readable
- Ensure tests are reliable and don't produce false positives
