# React & Next.js Rules

## Next.js App Router
- Use Next.js App Router (`app/` directory) instead of Pages Router
- Place pages in the `app/` directory following the new routing conventions

## Component Types
- Default to Server Components for better performance
- Only use Client Components when needed (add `'use client'` directive)
- Use async/await with fetch inside Server Components for data fetching

## Component Organization
- Organize components in the `components/` folder with clear, descriptive names
- Keep components small, composable, and reusable
- Follow single responsibility principle for each component

## File Structure
- Place components in [src/components/](mdc:src/components/)
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate component purpose
- Group related components in subdirectories when appropriate
