# Architecture Rules

## File Organization
- Place reusable utilities in [src/lib/](mdc:src/lib/)
- Place server actions in `app/actions/`
- Place shared types in `types/`
- Maintain clear separation of concerns

## Environment Variables
- Use environment variables only via Next.js `process.env`
- Type environment variables in `env.d.ts`
- Never commit sensitive environment variables

## Project Structure
- Follow Next.js App Router conventions
- Keep related files grouped logically
- Use consistent naming patterns across the project

## Code Organization
- Separate business logic from UI components
- Create clear boundaries between different layers
- Use dependency injection patterns where appropriate
